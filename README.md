# Cosmetic Dataset Analysis

TripleTen Feb Code Pudding: Cosmetic Dataset using Tableau

This project is from the TripleTen February 2025 Business Intelligence Analyst Code Jams. Code Jams are team events in which students compete against each other in small teams or pairs. These are free, voluntary projects that are open to any student who meets the eligibility requirements. It's a great opportunity to test yourself, gain new skills, and network with other students.
