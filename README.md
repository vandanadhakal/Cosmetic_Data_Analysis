# Cosmetic Dataset Analysis

TripleTen Feb Code Jam: Cosmetic Data Analysis using Tableau

This project is from the TripleTen February 2025 Business Intelligence Analyst Code Jams. Code Jams are team events in which students compete against each other in small teams or pairs. These are free, voluntary projects that are open to any student who meets the eligibility requirements. It's a great opportunity to test yourself, gain new skills, and network with other students.

<summary> Project Description </summary>
Whether you are in a cosmetic store, pharmacy, or in a grocery aisle, the volume of cosmetic options is overwhelming. Popular brands like La Mer, Estee Lauder, and Dior are really expensive; but are they any good? Does a higher cost indicate a more effective product? We want to discern which cosmetic brands and their respective product types are the best. To do this we will explored brands in terms of average price, ranking, and skin types. We defined a list of products and brands that are applicable to all skin types.

<summary> About the Data </summary>
The data for this project was provided by TripleTen. TripleTen sourced several data sets from Kaggle. Our team choose the cosmetics dataset because this dataset contains information on various cosmetic product information. The fields it contains are label (product types like moisturizer, cleanser, skin protection, etc.), brand name, product name, ingredients, price, rank, and skin types the products are applicable. We found this data to be compelling and relatable because we all use one or all of the product types.

<summary> Process </summary>
We reviewed that dataset in excel. We looked for problems with the dataset such as incomplete/ missing values and defined each field. We choose to use Tableau to analyze and present the data. We choose Tableau because of it's story point feature as well as its visualization flexibility. We started analyzing the data by creating a list of questions that the data could answer. We then developed a story around those questions and a subsequent outline for each story point.

<summary> Findings </summary>
•	There are 1,472 products among 117 brands that are applicable to a variety of skin type combinations

•	The average price range for cosmetics products is $10 - $184. Individual product prices range from $3 to $370. We explored the High End price and Low End average price of 10 brands (5 per high/low) to determine if a higher price indicates greater effectiveness

•	We found 61 products among 8 brands that are applicable to all skin types

•	We found that both high and low end brands have approxiamtely the same ranking. However, we found more products applicable to all skin types on the high end of pricing

<summary> Reflection </summary>
The TripleTen learning platform is primarily self-paced with deadlines to keep students on track. This project was fun because we go to work in groups. We were given a short deadline of 4 days to complete the EDA, Visualizations, and Presentation Story. This made the project feel more like work experience than a school project. The biggest challenge of this project was working across three different time zones (EST, CST, & PST). The analysis doesn’t take into consideration the product ingredients. Ingredients could have provided the effectiveness of a product in a more scientific way. Additionally, ranking is a bit ambigous. We don't have much information on the specifics of the ranking data. For example, is the ranking information obtained from individual users who voluntarily and impartially submit the data; or is the ranking information obtained directly from the brands?
